### Why `_for-sale`?

There are two main reasons we believe that `_for-sale` is a worthwhile idea.

**First**, the domain aftermarket is a reality we cannot ignore. In the .nl zone alone, hundreds of thousands of domain names lie unused and effectively dormant. When someone starts searching for a new domain name — for instance, to launch a new service — they often begin their search at SIDN (the .nl registry) or one of its registrars. What typically happens is:

- They look up the domain name idea in WHOIS  
- The domain is already registered  
- The user moves on to a different name  

This means that even if the domain is for sale, that fact is missed entirely at the moment it matters most: during the search.

By introducing a clear signal — “this domain is already registered, but *is* for sale” — we open up a new path. That domain name could still reach the interested party and enter active use, which aligns with SIDN’s longstanding ambition to maximize domain name usage.

**Second**, the aftermarket behaves oddly upon closer inspection. Here's why:  
Domain holders who want to let go of their names typically just cancel them. If the domain is deemed valuable, a domainer or drop-catcher will have been watching it and will immediately scoop it up upon deletion — acquiring it essentially for free and reselling it with a healthy profit margin.

Compare that to how car ownership works. When people want to part with a car — whether to buy a new one or go car-free — they usually sell it. Yes, there are dealers who buy up such used cars, refurbish them, and resell them for profit. But imagine a world where car owners send perfectly functional cars to the scrapyard, where second-hand dealers collect them for free and flip them for a profit. We’d find that system bizarre.

With `_for-sale`, we aim to bring domain name turnover closer to this more familiar model: owners who no longer need their domain name can mark it as for sale. Domainers and investors can pick up on that signal and decide: is this name worth anything to me? If so, they can make an offer — rather than waiting and hoping for it to drop, risking that a competitor will catch it first.

The `_for-sale` mechanism thus has the potential to reshape the domain aftermarket — making it more transparent and balanced for all parties involved.
